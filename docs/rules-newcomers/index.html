          <div class="page-toc"></div>
          <p>To survive and thrive, a community must attract and retain new members and help
them be productive. These rules, taken from <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Sholler2019">Sholler2019</a>]</span>, describe
how to do this.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h3>Communities of practice</h3>
<p>What exactly do we mean by &ldquo;community&rdquo;? In the case of open source and open
science, the most usual meaning is a
<span class="ix-entry" ix-key="community of practice" markdown="1"><a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#community_of_practice" markdown="1">community of practice</a></span>
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Lave1991">Lave1991</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Wenger1999">Wenger1999</a>]</span> with three characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Participants have a common product or purpose that they work on or
    toward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are mutually engaged, i.e., they assist and mentor each another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They develop shared resources and domain knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Be welcoming.</dt>
<dd>Projects should not just say that they welcome new members: they should make
an effort to foster positive feelings by posting a welcome message on the
project&rsquo;s social media, offering assistance in making an initial
contribution, and connecting them with existing project members.</dd>
<dt>Help potential contributors evaluate if the project is a good fit.</dt>
<dd>The first and most important step in being welcoming is to help them
determine whether this project is a good fit for their interests and
abilities.  To do this, the project should explicitly state what the
different types of skills required are. This information should be easily
accessible and guide new members to the tasks they may handle.</dd>
<dt>Make governance explicit.</dt>
<dd><span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Raymond2001">Raymond2001</a>]</span> described an egalitarian world in which everyone
could contribute equally to open projects. Two decades later, we can see how
misleading it was, and how unequal and unwelcoming projects can be if
authority lies with those willing to shout loudest and longest
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Cohen2018">Cohen2018</a>]</span>.  Large, well-established projects that incorporate
as non-profits are required to promulgate bylaws; smaller projects should
have some explicit <span class="ix-entry" ix-key="governance" markdown="1">governance</span> that explains who
gets a say in what and how to become someone whose vote counts
(<a class="x-ref" href="../important/">Chapter 2</a>).</dd>
<dt>Keep knowledge up to date and findable.</dt>
<dd>A single project may use wikis, files in GitHub, shared Google Docs, old
tweets or chat messages, and email archives; keeping information about a
specific topic in a single place and clearly defining the purpose of each
communication medium saves newcomers from having to navigate multiple
unfamiliar data sources to find what they need <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Lin2020">Lin2020</a>]</span>.  At the
same time, outdated documentation may lead newcomers to understand the
project incorrectly, which is also demotivating. While it&rsquo;s hard to keep
material up to date, community members should at least remove or clearly
mark outdated information.</dd>
<dt>Have and enforce a <span class="ix-entry" ix-key="Code of Conduct" markdown="1">Code of Conduct</span>.</dt>
<dd>We discussed this rule in <a class="x-ref" href="../starting/">Chapter 3</a>, but it bears repeating here.
Your project&rsquo;s culture is defined by the worst behavior it tolerates
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Gruenert2015">Gruenert2015</a>]</span>, and every instance of bad behavior will drive
current and potential contributors away.</dd>
<dt>Develop forms of legitimate peripheral participation.</dt>
<dd>Newcomers become members of a community by participating in simple, low-risk
tasks that existing community members believe are valuable. Through this
<span class="ix-entry" ix-key="legitimate peripheral participation" markdown="1"><a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#lpp" markdown="1">legitimate peripheral participation</a></span>, newcomers become acquainted with the community&rsquo;s
tasks, vocabulary, and governance so that they can ease into the
project. For example, submitting pull requests on GitHub can be daunting for
newcomers; asking people to file issues about bugs they have found requires
less up-front work, but is accepted as also being useful.</dd>
<dt>Make it easy for newcomers to get started.</dt>
<dd>One way to facilitate legitimate peripheral participation is to make it easy
for newcomers to get set up so that they can start work on contributions.
Getting set up to work on a project—going from &ldquo;I want to help&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
able to help&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m helping&rdquo;—is often someone&rsquo;s first experience as a
community participant. Any complexity or confusion at this point is
therefore a significant barrier to participation
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Steinmacher2014">Steinmacher2014</a>]</span>. By treating the process of getting involved
with the same care and attention you give to the product itself, you&rsquo;re
making it clear that you value those contributors&rsquo; time and effort</dd>
<dt>Use opportunities for in-person interaction—with care.</dt>
<dd>Combining newcomer-friendly events and activities with larger gatherings
such as conferences amortize participants&rsquo; financial costs and travel time.
However, potential contributors might shy away from the project if they are
introverted, suffer from social anxiety, or have had bad experiences in the
past in face-to-face settings. A Code of Conduct helps allay these concerns,
but some newcomers may still feel uncomfortable in group settings. In this
case, not going to a meetup may leave them feeling less a part of the
community.</dd>
<dt>Acknowledge all contributions.</dt>
<dd>People in open source sometimes joke that a programmer is someone who will
do something for a laptop sticker that they would not do for a hundred
dollars. The kernel of truth in this joke is that gratitude and recognition
are the most powerful tools community builders have. It is therefore crucial
to acknowledge newcomers&rsquo; contributions and thank them for their work.
Every project should therefore adopt and publicize guidelines describing
what constitutes a contribution, how contributions will be acknowledged, and
how they will be used.</dd>
<dt>Follow up on both success and failure.</dt>
<dd>Once someone has carried their first contribution over the line, you and
they are likely to have a better sense of what they have to offer and how
the project can help them. Helping newcomers find the next problem they
might want to work on or pointing them at the next thing they might enjoy
reading is both helpful and supportive. In particular, encouraging them to
help the next wave of newcomers is both a good way to recognize what they
have learned, and an effective way to pass it on.</dd>
