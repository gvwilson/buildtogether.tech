          <div class="page-toc"></div>
          <p>An old proverb says, &ldquo;If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far,
go together.&rdquo;  In my experience, this is wrong: both speed and distance come
from having partners.  Researchers and practitioners can each do great things on
their own, but both are better able to solve problems that really matter if they
find ways to work together.</p>
<h2>If You Are a Researcher in Academia</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Remember that companies work in weeks, not seasons.</dt>
<dd>Academic semesters are rooted in the seasons of an agricultural era, but
practitioners in industry have to work at a more accelerated pace. In the
time it takes you to write a grant, a company might develop and release two
new versions of their product in order to keep up with their competition.
Discuss timescales with your industrial research partners early on, and be
realistic about how slowly things will proceed.</dd>
<dt>Be open.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Research is of no use to practitioners who cannot easily find it and read
it. While <span class="ix-entry" ix-key="Wales, Jimmy" markdown="1">Jimmy Wales</span> (the founder of <span class="ix-entry" ix-key="Wikipedia" markdown="1">Wikipedia</span>) may not actually have said, &ldquo;Open
information drives out closed,&rdquo; the principle holds: with so much
information freely available on the Internet, any paywall or login barrier
put between you and your hoped-for audience will send a large number of
people elsewhere.</p>
<p>More importantly, these barriers send a clear signal that you do not care if
practitioners read your work or not: as one colleague observed rather
sourly, it&rsquo;s the equivalent of inviting people to your house for dinner and
then expecting them to pay for the drinks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Value action over insight.</dt>
<dd>The goal for practitioners is not to understand the world, but to change
it. &ldquo;We know X&rdquo; is much less useful to them than &ldquo;we can do Y&rdquo;. When
presenting your findings, you should therefore focus on how someone might
act on it.  One way to do this is to add slides titled, &ldquo;What Difference
Does It Make?&rdquo; at strategic points in your presentations. If you can&rsquo;t think
of what to write next, you may want to rethink what you&rsquo;re focused on.</dd>
<dt>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to sacrifice detail for clarity.</dt>
<dd>Understanding doesn&rsquo;t have to be complete in order to be actionable. You may
need to hedge conclusions with qualifiers in order to get your work past
Reviewer #3, but those &ldquo;maybes&rdquo; and &ldquo;howevers&rdquo; can often be omitted if they
don&rsquo;t change what practitioners should try next.</dd>
<dt>Apologize in advance for the state of academic publishing.</dt>
<dd>Modern academic publishing isn&rsquo;t actually a conspiracy by a handful of large
companies to line their pockets with government money that could and should
be used to lift researchers out of penury, but it is functionally
indistinguishable from a system that was. The best way to prepare your
industry partners for its Kafkaesque production pipelines and interminable
delays is to have them watch <span class="ix-entry" ix-key="Gilliam, Terry" markdown="1">Terry Gilliam</span>&lsquo;s
movie <em>Brazil</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>If You Are a Practitioner in Industry</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Remember that universities work in seasons, not weeks.</dt>
<dd>The timescale mis-match described in Rule #1 is due in part to the fact that
academic researchers are almost always multi-tasking, and that many of those
tasks are things they&rsquo;ve never been trained to do. As students, they juggle
several courses at once (which effectively means that they answer to several
bosses who don&rsquo;t communicate with each other). Later, they are responsible
for teaching, writing grant proposals, and administrative duties.  This mean
that their &ldquo;work week&rdquo; is only a few hours long, and that they will often
appear to move at a snail&rsquo;s pace. Be as sympathetic as you can: they are
even less happy with the situation than you are.</dd>
<dt>Remember that academic success is measured in publications, not sales.</dt>
<dd>University presidents routinely make about the economic value of research,
but the only things that truly matter for academic advancement are
publication, publication, and publication. Researchers are not given grants
or tenure for doing things that are &ldquo;merely useful&rdquo;, even if doing so
requires a deep understanding of subtle complexities and months of hard
work. For all the jokes practitioners make about the ivory tower, academic
life is hard, uncertain, and poorly paid. People stay in it for the love of
new knowledge; respecting their priorities is essential to building a
productive relationship. (That said, practical problems often do unlock the
door to genuinely new research topics by pushing researchers out of their
comfort zone.)</dd>
<dt>Do the background reading.</dt>
<dd><span class="ix-entry" ix-key="Mencken, H.L." markdown="1">H.L. Mencken</span> once wrote that, &ldquo;There is
always a well-known solution to every human problem—neat, plausible, and
wrong.&rdquo; Your problem is almost certainly one of those, and is almost
certainly more complex than you first realize. While Rule #4 tells
researchers to sacrifice detail for clarity, this rule asks practitioners to
make an effort to grasp at least some of that detail so that you don&rsquo;t waste
time reinventing wheels and so that your research partner can think, work,
and talk at full speed.</dd>
<dt>Don&rsquo;t overstate what has been learned.</dt>
<dd>This rule is also a complement to Rule #4. The &ldquo;maybes&rdquo; and &ldquo;howevers&rdquo; that
researchers are so fond of do sometimes matter; if your research partner has
found that regular doses of a new drug seems to slow tumor growth in lab
rats, do not embarrass them by claiming that they have discovered a cure for
cancer.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>If You Are Either</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Apologize in advance for the state of your data.</dt>
<dd>The final rule applies equally to both researchers and practitioners. Files&rsquo;
names and locations, the meanings of column headers in tables, how those
tables relate to one another, how missing values are represented and
handles: everything that has made sense to you for years will suddenly seem
a little foolish when you have to explain it to someone else. Apologize in
advance, and then forgive yourself, because no matter how bad your data is,
theirs may well be worse.</dd>
