How did you do?

5 or less
:   There is a lot of room for improvement, but don't try to fix everything at
    once.  Instead, get the team to agree to tackle one thing at time.

6--10
:   Most mature development teams are in this range and can bootstrap other
    improvements they need on their own.

11 or higher
:   If you're looking for a job, please let me know.  (Hell, if you're *hiring*,
    let me know that tooâ€¦)
