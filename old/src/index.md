If you are an undergraduate student embarking on a semester-long software
project as part of a team, this book will give you tools that will help you
succeed.  Some of these are purely technical, like a version control system or
an IDE; others are guidelines to help you form teams, manage people who aren't
pulling their weight, cut features when time runs short, and understand who owns
the things you produce.

Our aim is to teach you how to be a *compassionate programmer*: one who cares as
much about the well-being of their colleagues and users as they do about their
own.  This focus is not entirely altruistic—everything you do to help others
also helps your future self—but now that we all know how much harm software
can do, we hope you'll be interested in some practical idealism.
