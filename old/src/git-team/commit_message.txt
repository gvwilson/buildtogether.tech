One-line summary

Detailed explanatory text separated from the summary by a blank line.  (If you
do this, many tools will treat the first line like the subject of an email and
the rest of the text as the body.)

Be brief but specific and write your message in the imperative voice, i.e.,
"Handle indentation in configuration files correctly" rather than "Config file
indentation."

- Bullet points are OK (GitHub will format them as a list).  Some other Markdown
  conventions work too.

If this commit fixes an open issue, refer to it like as shown below. GitHub
automatically turns things like `#123` into links.

Closes: #123
