      The aim of this tutorial is to teach you how to be a *compassionate programmer*:
      one who cares as much about the well-being of their colleagues and users
      as they do about their own.
      This focus is not entirely altruistic—everything you do to help others also helps you—but
      now that we all know how much harm software can do,
      we hope you'll be interested in some practical idealism.
