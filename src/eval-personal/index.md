title: Personal Evaluation
---

The material below is adapted from the guidelines for annual performance reviews
at a well-known software development company.  It's an accurate depiction of
what companies care about, and can be used as a starting point for
self-evaluation or peer evaluation in a project course.

## Software Engineering

Includes technical design; architecture; coding; debugging; testing; performance
optimization; release; and maintenance.

Records technical requirements, architectural decisions, and other relevant information.
:   Does "just enough" design to answer all stakeholders' questions; analyzes
    and reviews peers' designs; takes resource usage into account during design;
    no "hidden features"; takes security needs into account.

Plans for evolution and maintenance.
:   Avoids excessive dependencies; allows for future maintenance; accounts for
    deployment issues, particularly upgrades.

Uses configuration management system effectively.
:   All project-related material is versioned; never breaks the build; all
    changes are connected to issues in an auditable way.

Uses issue tracking system effectively.
:   All questions, tasks, and bugs are issues; all work is associated with
    issues; issues are kept up to date to serve as a basis for auditable status
    reports; avoids creating redundant/duplicate issues.

Manages schedule.
:   Provides time estimates on work items, and updates completion estimates as
    work progresses; proactively reports delays and other scheduling-related
    issues to affected stakeholders; proactively searches for ways to reduce the
    project's critical path.

Conforms to company coding guidelines.
:   Code always passes format checks; documentation of all inter-module and
    externally-visible APIs is always up to date on main branch;
    developer-oriented documentation phrased in terms of recognized design
    patterns where relevant.

## Communication

Includes verbal communication; written reports; presentations; email; wikis;
blogs; active listening skills; feedback and critiques.

Effectively communicates with peers and stakeholders in a
:   Regular and timely fashion.  collaborates regularly with colleagues from
    other divisions; updates manager and team regularly and accurately on
    status.

Asks for assistance when needed.
:   Seeks answers before asking for assistance, but escalates problems when
    blocked; when asking for help, clearly and accurately explains what has been
    tried, and why it didn't work.

Provides helpful feedback to peers.
:   Takes active role in design meetings, code reviews, etc.; provides specific
    examples and suggestions for improvement when critiquing colleagues' work.

Improves efficiency.
:   Automates repetitive tasks through scripts, macros, etc.; proactively does
    in-phase work that will reduce time and overhead in subsequent work phases.

Proactively expands network of personal contacts.
:   Participates in relevant internal discussion groups; takes initiative to
    establish contacts with colleagues in upstream and downstream groups.

## Domain expertise

Includes sharing knowledge; innovating; continued development of personal
skills.

Proactively shares knowledge with peers.
:   Mentoring; blogging tips and tricks; updating project wiki; provides
    training.

Looks for opportunities to innovate.
:   Willing to import relevant knowledge from other groups/projects/companies;
    stays current with relevant literature; proposes and pursues patents.

Actively improves expertise.
:   Attends training courses; seeks to understand goals and techniques of
    upstream and downstream groups; proactively adopts good practices used by
    peers.

## Leadership

Includes communicating vision to peers and subordinates; fostering a supportive
environment; taking a "big picture" view of product development.

Takes part in team-building activities.
:   Interviews potential hires; helps orient new hires; communicates
    consistently with subordinates regarding their status and performance; takes
    part in out-of-hours social events.

Solves problems proactively and methodically.
:   Identifies risks; prioritizes outstanding issues; looks for
    low-cost/low-risk ways to solve or avoid problems; prefers "win-win"
    solutions to "zero-sum" solutions.

Uses metrics for process improvement.
:   Measures and records development times, memory/CPU loads, etc.; translates
    this data into recommendations for process and/or product improvement.

Contributes to project planning.
:   Participates in postmortems; evaluates feasibility of design and feature
    proposals; explains technical issues/opportunities to upstream and
    downstream colleagues.
