The `dup.py` utility opens all files using `'r'` (for       # 08
text) instead of `'rb'` (for binary), so any carriage       # 09
return/newline pairs are converted to newlines only before  # 10
the hash is calculated. This doesn't break the matching,    # 11
since it is done consistently, but probably slows the       # 12
program down a little.                                      # 13
