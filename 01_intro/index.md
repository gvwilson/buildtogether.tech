# Introduction

Our aim is to teach you to be a [compassionate programmer](g:compassionate-programmer):
one who cares as much about the well-being of their colleagues and users
as they do about their own.
This focus is not entirely altruistic—everything you do to help others
also helps your future self—but now that we know how much harm software can do,
we need to learn to build it in better ways.

## Topics

Life is short and your project is even shorter,
so this book focuses on
the things that will help you the most in the short term:

-   How to work effectively in a small team
    when you are constantly being interrupted by other tasks
    like the homework for your other courses.

-   How a few simple changes in your study habits
    will enable you to learn more and more quickly.

-   What legal rights you have to the software you create as a student
    (and on the job).

## Audience

Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.
These are ours:

-   Yanina is in the third year of a computer science degree.
    She worked on several volunteer projects in high school and through her mosque,
    but the "Introduction to Software Engineering" course she's about to take
    will be her first semester-long team project at university.
    This guide will help her and her teammates figure out what to do when.

-   Brad is in Yanina's classes.
    He started programming when he was nine years old,
    and as a result can do many assignments in half the time it takes other students
    (something he attributes to intelligence and aptitude
    rather than to his parents being able to afford to send him to after-school coding camps).
    He finds any discussion of what he privately called "social justice bullshit" tiresome;
    this guide will help him understand why that attitude is self-defeating.

-   Ahmadou worked as an illustrator for several years
    before doing an intensive 14-week conversion course to become a JavaScript developer.
    He has a lot of experience working in teams to meet deadlines,
    but is still often bewildered by the tools, jargon, and culture of programming.
    This guide will help him figure out what his new colleagues think is "normal".

-   Sharla teaches JavaScript at Yanina's college
    and for the conversion course that Ahmadou went through.
    They taught the "Introduction to Software Engineering" class last semester,
    and came away feeling that their students had wasted a lot of time
    on things that turned out not to be useful.
    This guide will help them give more structure to the next offering
    and set more realistic expectations.
