"""Handle file inclusions

The `[% inc ... %]` shortcode includes other files or portions of
other files:

-   `[% inc file="path" %]` includes an entire file. The path is
    relative to the including file.

-   `[% inc file="path" keep="key" %]` includes everything between
    lines marked with `[key]` and `[/key]`.  (These markers are usually
    placed in comments.)

-   `[% inc file="path" omit="key" %]` omits everything between
    markers.

-   `[% inc file="path" keep="outer" omit="inner" %]` selects the
    lines within the `outer` section, then omits lines within that
    section marked with `inner`.

-   `[% inc pat="path.*" fill="one two" %]` includes the files
    `path.one` and `path.two` (i.e., replaces `*` in `pat` with each
    of the tokens in `fill`, then includes all of that file).

-   `[% inc file="path" head="N" %]` keeps the first N lines.

To make this work:

-   `filter_files` tells Ark to only process files ending in `.html`
    and `.md` so that it won't try to templatize source code files.

-   `copy_files` copies all of the files used as inclusions to the
    output directory so that they can be linked to. It assumes that
    a chapter or appendix `A` generates `docs/A/index.html` so that
    the included file can be copied to `docs/A/whatever`.

-   `include` handles file inclusion.  If the `node` argument is
    empty, it's too early in the processing cycle, so the function
    does nothing; otehrwise, it dispatches to a case-specific handler.
